<h1> Create Django App </h1>

Easy **one-line command** to create a Django app with all the **dependencies auto-installed**, and **built-in support for**:
- package managers (**pipenv, poetry**)
- web servers (**dev, gunicorn, uwsgi**)
- connecting to different databases (**MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite3**)
- data model creation
- CRUD API creation (**REST, GraphQL**)
- unit tests and test coverage reporting
- autogenerated test factories (**FactoryBoy**)
- linting and code formatting (**autopep8, isort**)
- autogenerated API documentation (**Swagger, ReDoc**)

<br/>

<h2> Overview </h2>

- Run the following command in your terminal:
```
npm install -g imagine && imagine create -f django -n myapp 
```
(If you don't have npm installed, you'll need to [install this first](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-install).)

- You should see this:

```
$ npm install -g imagine && imagine create -f django -n myapp 

changed 214 packages, and audited 215 packages in 5s

32 files written
You have successfully created a new project!
Now you can run "cd myapp && imagine run" to install the dependencies and open a web server running at
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

- You can now run your new Django app by running `cd myapp && imagine run`. 
- When you open http://127.0.0.1:8000/, you should see that the install worked successfully.

- Congrats! Your Django app is up and running!

- Now that you've created your new app, check out the `myapp.im` in your app directory - using this you can: 
  - easily change your app settings such as django server and package manager, API format etc.
  - add app functionality such as data models, APIs, storage etc using a simple config spec. 

- Learn more about how you can use Imagine to generate code at www.imagine.ai.

<h2> Detail </h2>

<h3> Easy to create </h3>

- Our one-line command allows your to get started with your Django app immediately, without worrying about installing dependencies - we use commonly used dependencies to help you get started with your app, so you can focusing on writing business logic. Don't worry, you can always change the settings to your preferences later (see the next section: "Easy to customize").


- Our default settings when we create your django app are as follows: 
  - Server:                 dev
  - Package manager:        pipenv
  - Django models layout:   single-file
  - Project directory name: microservice
  - API format:             REST
  - Database:               sqlite
  - Database name:          myapp

<br/>

<h3> Easy to customize </h3>

- If you want to change any of the above defaults for your app, its a piece of cake.

- Go to the myapp.im file in your directory, your should see the basic default settings here:

</br>

```
settings

app:
    # your application name
    name: myapp
    # choose one: [django, node]
    framework: django

django:
    # choose one: [pipenv, poetry]
    package-manager: pipenv
    # choose one: [gunicorn, uwsgi, dev]
    server: dev

    layout:
        # choose one: [single-file, separate-files]
        models: single-file
        # name of the project settings directory:
        project-dir: microservice

api:
    # choose one: [rest, graphql]
    format: rest

end settings

# database <database type: [sqlite, mysql, posgresql]> <database name>
database sqlite myapp-db 

```
  
- You can replace the default settings with your preferences (based on the options allowed), and then run `imagine compile myapp.im` in your terminal. Your app and will be updated with the new settings.

<h3> Easy to add app functionality </h3>

- Not only can you change your app settings easily, you can also generated production-ready code using the `myapp.im` file. 


- Use Imagine's simple syntax to add [data models](www.imagine.ai/docs/model) and [CRUD APIs](www.imagine.ai/docs/api) to your Django app. 


- Run `imagine compile myapp.im` to see the generated code.

- PS - all our generated code has:
  - unit tests and test coverage reporting
  - autogenerated test factories (using FactoryBoy)
  - linting and code formatting (you can select autopep8 or isort)
  - autogenerated API documentation (using Swagger and ReDoc)

- Enjoy!
